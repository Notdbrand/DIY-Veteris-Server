# Difteris  
This github repo contains the code for a custom server that was built for veteris 1.7.2, as well as the code and deb for a redirect tweak that can change the veteris url to any url.  
This server was not made or related to Electimon or InvoxiPlayGames, so if there is a problem with either the tweak or server, don't bug them. Instead email me or open an issue in this github repo.  

## Part 1: Difteris Server Setup  
Do later  





















## Part 2: Veteris client setup  
### Step 1: Downgrade Veteris  
There is two methods to downgrading  
- 1: Downgrade using cydia's downgrade option  
- 2: Uninstall Veteris and download the deb archive.org (https://web.archive.org/web/20231119205614/https://yzu.moe/dev/packs/Veteris-v1.7.2.deb)  
  
  
### Step 2: Download Veteris Redirect  
Install Veteris redirect either from within this github or install it from my repo at https://notdbrand.com/repo  

Or if you want to complie it yourself, use theos to compile the tweak.
  
  
### Step 3: Configure the tweak  
To configure the tweak go to setting a scroll down to Veteris Redirect then go into the setting.  
In the Veteris Redirect page enter just the ip address or url for your server. Don't include http:// or the port number.  

  
### Step 4: Apply the tweak  
Now to apply the redirect click the back button then go back into the tweak page.  
This is because if you just hit respring it won't save.  

  
## Enjoy  
Now you should be able to start veteris and it should connect to your server.
